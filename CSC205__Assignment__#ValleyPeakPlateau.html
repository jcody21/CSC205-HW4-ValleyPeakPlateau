<h3>Specification</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
Copy the program <a href="http://azfoo.net/gdt/csc205/assignments/02019/ValleyPeakPlateau.java.txt">ValleyPeakPlateau.java</a>
to your computer and implement the method named 
<b>valley_peak_plateau(int[])</b>.
</p>
<p>
The <b>static void valley_peak_plateau(int[] a)</b> method prints to the 
standard output stream the valleys, peaks, and plateaus found in 
the <b>int[] a</b> parameter. Only arrays having two or more elements 
are processed.
</p>
<p>
The following are definitions for <i>valley</i>, 
<i>peak</i>, and <i>plateau</i>.  Note:  A <i>plateau</i>
is when a number occurs three or more consecutive times
in an array.
</p>
<b><pre>   note:
      int[] a ... an array of ints of named a
      int n ... the length of array a, where n &#8805; 2 
      int i ... index into array a

   when i is 0
      a[i] is valley if a[i] less than a[i+1]
      a[i] is peak if a[i] greater than a[i+1]
      a[i] is plateau if a[i] equals a[i+1] and a[i+2]

   when 0 &lt; i &lt; n - 1
      a[i] is valley if a[i] is less than both a[i-1] and a[i+1]
      a[i] is peak if a[i] is greater than both a[i-1] and a[i+1]
      a[i] is plateau if a[i] equals both a[i-1] and a[i+1]
           note:  a[i-1] is the start of the plateau and the
                  plateau ends when the number changes (or end 
                  of array is reached) -- see the output if 
                  clarification is needed

   when i is n - 1
      a[i] is valley if a[i] less than a[i-1]
      a[i] is peak if a[i] greater than a[i-1]
      a[i] is plateau if a[i] equals a[i-1] and a[i-2]
